# k-Means-Clustering-to-enhance-SEO
 In relation to Data Mining, Search Engine Optimisation is associated with applying rigorous analysis to datasets
which encompass data such as performance in terms of content and user behaviour. The goal is to convert this data into
actionable insights to improve page rank and increase organic traf ic. It is of utmost importance for webmasters to
optimize SEO factors to satisfy the search engines and thereby attain more visibility. This paper introduces a novel
approach to draw valuable, reliable, and practical insights from Google Search Console using k-Means Clustering to draw
focus on the influence of various SEO factors. The factors taken from Google Search Console include Page, Query,
Clicks, Impressions, CTR, and Position. Other parameters like length of the title and Meta Description should be included
from web crawlers. The clustering technique enables one to gain insight into which parameters should be optimised for
maximum impact.
